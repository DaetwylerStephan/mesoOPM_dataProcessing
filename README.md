# mesoOPM_dataProcessing

This script is associated with the publication of the mesoscopic oblique plane microscope "Mesoscopic Oblique Plane Microscopy via Light-sheet Mirroring" by Daetwyler et al. (2023). The stitching python code provides a straightforward custom Python code to fuse different tiles imaged on the microscope.
